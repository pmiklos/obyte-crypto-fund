# Decentralized Cryptocurrency Fund

A collection of Obyte Autonomous Agents that manage baskets of assets issued on the Obyte distributed ledger.
Thanks to the [Counterstake](https://counterstake.org) cross-chain bridge, assets from other chains can be imported to
Obyte and added to the fund creating a true cross-chain decentralized cryptocurrency fund.
